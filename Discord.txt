Hey guys,

I've decided to release my battle bot made in autoit. It was designed for couch potato farming in grizzleheim and was designed to grow to a larger project but I have lost interest in the game.

What it does:

- Enchants school spells then attacks.
- Detects needing to pass incase mob joins late and not enough pips.
- Detects out of battle and spams movement so you can join battles sooner.
- Has a counter to keep track of your current mana, then uses potions when it should be empty (can sometimes mess up)
- Compatible for every enchantment. Also compatible for all schools but death, as long as you are using AOE's.

No known bans related to autoit programs/scripts but as always use at your own caution.
