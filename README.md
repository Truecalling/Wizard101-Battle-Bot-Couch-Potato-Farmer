# Autoit Battle Bot made in Autoit
I'm releasing my battle bot made in autoit. It was designed to fight battles in grizzleheim but can also be used to farm glitched bosses (hits more and done button).

Currently the features are as followed: -Pass only (will only pass and make small movements) -Supports all schools but death -Enchants your attack spell if available -Attacks -Passes when detecting needing more pips to save time -Moves forward and backwards after battle to engage battle faster -Mana input to keep track of mana -Replenishes mana with a potion when counter runs down -GUI keeps track of attacks made, attacks left before taking potion, potions, and cards enchanted -GUI has a debug status label (mostly accurate)

If you are going to add this to your project please give credits, thanks.
