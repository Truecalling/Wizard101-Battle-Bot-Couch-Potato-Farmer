This is a basic battle bot constructed in autoit. It enchants your schools spells and attacks for you. It will also replenish your mana with potions once you have ran out of mana.

Instructions:

- Windows scaling must be at 100%
- Monitor must be 1920x1080
- Put the w101 client in windowed mode, 800x600
- Make sure Bloom is on. Bot tends to work better with bloom on.
- Fill deck with only mass AOE and enchants, get rid of all wands cards and other spells.
- Stand near or in battle, then run the program, select your school and fill in asked data. I usually subtract 50 mana from the asked mana total just incase the bot messes up counters.
- Profit from couch potato seeds .
- UI size must be Normal.

Note:Autoit can fuckup if Wizard101 client is ran as admin. Make sure its under regular perms.
